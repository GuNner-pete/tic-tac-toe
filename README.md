# Tic Tac Toe- Microverse Ruby Project #3

This is the code for the Microverse Tic Tac Toe Project in the Microverse Ruby Course.
The goal is to create a playable Tic Tac Toe game in the command line. 


## Live Code

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/acushlakoncept/Enumerable)](https://repl.it/@JohnHernCode/tictactoe-game-ruby#main.rb)

## Built With

- Plain Ruby
- Rubocop

This project was built using plain ruby. 

## Usage

- git clone https://github.com/JohnHernCode/tic-tac-toe.git
- cd tic-tac-toe in terminal
- Type 'bin/main.rb' in your terminal to start the game.

## Instructions to Play the Game

Now that you have the game open, let's walk through the game play.

- First add the names of the two players
- Player one will be X.
- Player two will be O.
- Each player will take turns picking spots on the game board.
- Whomever fills three(3) spots in a straight line (horizontally or diagonally) first, is the winner
- If the whole game board fills up without either X or O having three(3) boxes in a row, the game ends in a draw.
- Once the results are in, you see who the winner is, and then you can choose to play again, or type 'n' to exit the game.

Good luck and enjoy.
