## Live Code

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/acushlakoncept/Enumerable)](https://repl.it/@JohnHernCode/tictactoe-game-ruby#main.rb)

## Built With

- Plain Ruby
- Rubocop

This project was built using plain ruby. 

## Usage

- git clone https://github.com/JohnHernCode/tic-tac-toe.git
- cd tic-tac-toe in terminal
- Type 'bin/main.rb' in your terminal to start the game.


## Instructions to Play the Game

Now that you have the game open, let's walk through the game play.

- First add the names of the two players
- Player one will be X.
- Player two will be O.
- Each player will take turns picking spots on the game board.
- Whomever fills three(3) spots in a straight line (horizontally or diagonally) first, is the winner
- If the whole game board fills up without either X or O having three(3) boxes in a row, the game ends in a draw.
- Once the results are in, you see who the winner is, and then you can choose to play again, or type 'n' to exit the game.

Good luck, we hope you like it, and enjoy.
